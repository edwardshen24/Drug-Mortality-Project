# Overview
This project aims to visualize drug mortality rates across the United States from 1999 to 2014 using data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The visualization is created in Tableau and allows users to explore drug mortality trends filtered by county and year. The counties are color-coded to provide a clear and intuitive understanding of mortality rates across different counties and years.
